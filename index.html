<div class="notice">
<h2 style="background-color:darkblue;">This was a hard decision to make</h2>
<ul>
<li>After we lost all our data and had to start fresh, the site became even less active than it was before.</li>
<li>I didn't really want to do this, but I don't see any point in keeping up the site for longer.</li>
<li>There's a small chance I'd bring the site back, but that depends on if anybody would use it.</li>
<li>That's it....for now. I'm working on another project (currently codenamed ticTac, just like squareBracket was at the beginning).</li>
<li>Check this page again in a few days, there might be squareBracket (again) or news regarding my other project. Bye.</li>
